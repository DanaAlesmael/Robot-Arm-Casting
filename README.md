# Robot-Arm-Casting

Casting technique was used in this project to model the robot's arm; The reason for this was to design the arm using a specific type of material allowing it to handshak other normal people as well as for protection purposes. 

* The website below was found to download a 3D hand model: https://free3d.com/3d-models/stl-hand
* Using Boole technique, the process was done. 
* Holes were important to create for easier parts connection.
